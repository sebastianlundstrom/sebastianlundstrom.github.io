                <p><h3>Client</h3>
                    <p>Qvantum has been a Swedish heat pump manufacturer for 30 years, initially specializing in custom-built industrial heat pumps. They have recently entered the consumer market with connected heat pumps designed for smart homes. The company’s goal is to provide their award-winning sustainable heat pump solutions for residential use.<p/>
                
                    <h3>Project</h3>
                    <p>Qvantum needed a software tool that could remotely monitor and manage installed heat pumps to support their after-sales and support teams. This tool would help with installation, troubleshooting, and ongoing maintenance, improving overall customer service.</p>
                
                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>Research:</strong> Conducted workshops and one-on-one interviews with support team members and managers to gather insights into their needs for remote support. Focused on understanding the pain points and requirements of the after-sales team, aiming to create a tool that would make troubleshooting and monitoring as easy as possible.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Created high-level feature descriptions based on the research findings. Developed wireframes and interactive prototypes to visualize the user experience and key functionalities.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Worked with managers, users and the development team, providing mockups and feature descriptions to ensure the deliverables aligned with the design vision.</p>
                
                    <h3>Delivered Solutions</h3>
                    <p><strong>High-Level Feature Descriptions:</strong> Defined essential features and functionalities for the remote support tool.</p>
                    <p><strong>User Flows:</strong> For handling single and multiple heat pump installations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Wireframes & Prototypes:</strong> Designed detailed wireframes and prototypes for the web-based support tool, consumer mobile app, and factory assembly software.</p>
                
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>A web-based software tool that enables the after-sales team to monitor, troubleshoot, and control multiple heat pumps remotely.</p>
                    <p><strong>Heat pump information:</strong> Access detailed data on individual heat pumps.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sensor graph comparison:</strong> View and compare real-time sensor graphs for multiple units.</p>
                    <p><strong>Alarm trigger lists:</strong> Easily identify and troubleshoot issues using automated alarm triggers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Saved heat pumps:</strong> Search for and temporarily save specific heat pumps for continuous monitoring over time.</p>
                    
                    <p>This tool enhanced the after-sales team’s ability to provide fast and effective support to heat pump installers, leading to improved customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.</p>
